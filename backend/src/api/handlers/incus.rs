//! Incus/LXC Container Image API handlers.
//!
//! Implements endpoints for uploading, downloading, and discovering Incus
//! container and VM images via the SimpleStreams protocol.
//!
//! Uploads use **streaming I/O** — the request body is written to disk
//! frame-by-frame, so memory stays flat regardless of image size.
//! Both monolithic (single PUT) and chunked/resumable uploads are supported.
//!
//! Routes mounted at `/incus/{repo_key}/...` and (as an alias for repos
//! created with `format: lxc`) `/lxc/{repo_key}/...`:
//!   GET    /streams/v1/index.json              - SimpleStreams index
//!   GET    /streams/v1/images.json             - SimpleStreams product catalog
//!   GET    /images/{product}/{version}/{file}  - Download image file
//!   PUT    /images/{product}/{version}/{file}  - Monolithic upload (streaming)
//!   DELETE /images/{product}/{version}/{file}  - Delete image file
//!   POST   /images/{product}/{version}/{filename}/uploads - Start chunked upload
//!   PATCH  /uploads/{uuid}                     - Upload chunk
//!   PUT    /uploads/{uuid}                     - Complete chunked upload
//!   DELETE /uploads/{uuid}                     - Cancel chunked upload
//!   GET    /uploads/{uuid}                     - Check upload progress
